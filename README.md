# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is very important  because it shows that the project is realistic and of good impact. Project managers need to come up with a schedule that put into consideration every constraints of the project. 

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?v
Effective cost control helps not to overbudget. It helps to put the project in control. And to prevent budget overrun, calculate the project constraints altogether. Dont ever under budget but a a project can be over.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodologies is an iterative and incremental approach to project. The project keeps getting better and better as the project goes on while Waterfall Methodologies is a linear and sequential approach to proect which means we complete each phase before we move to the next phase. 
For Agile, there is quick response to change and feedback from customer but less predictability. For Waterfall, it has a clear structure and documentation but very difficult to accommodate changes and testing can be late in the process.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial because it requires customer's involvement and changes can be done at any time. Creating a banking app for examples requires a feedback from the users then or work on the feedback. 

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Quality Assurance and control are methods to implement for quality purposes in the project, for example, code reviews, peer reviews, and walkthroughs. It is important because, we have standards guiding the development of the project. 

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the scope helps to understand how realistic it is to develop the project. During this phase, you try to check out the constraints towards the budget with KPIs. WBS is a tool for breaking down the projects into smaller phases and manageable components. It is useful because it helps to create structure and planning.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
This helps you to plan each phases of the project and Gantt charts assist by understanding the resource allocation.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
The major issue is to create a simple Hospital CRM tool and also track the accounting information such as the income and expenses. It is significant because it most small scall hospital does not have the finance of implementing the  big ERPs thereby using papers to keep patient records. 

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Once a problem is clearly define, solution will be great through effective communication.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
Keeping hospital records intacts and readily available.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Easy to use. UI/UX, easy to use Dashboards

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
There are several small scale hospitals that are still using paper to records their patients details. 

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Market trends is also important in the development of the software in order not to develop an outdated project.
